Welcome to A Tale of Two Foes, Alpha Version 0.02.

Please note that:
THIS IS A ALPHA VERSION OF A TALE OF TWO FOES. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING COULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

CHANGES:
A sharper looking menu
No longer in the INTER-DIMENSIONAL VOID (Thanks Tyler)
Repeated talking after pressing the right arrow bug fixed

WHAT TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE NEXT ALPHA:
An introductory backstory screen thingy after you press start
Changing the direction that you look when you move

NOTE:
It has now been confirmed that any alpha versions with 2 digits after the decimal points will include a monologue by Chad. For example, Alpha version 0.01, 0.03, and 1.23 will include a Chad monologue, but Alpha version 1.0, 2.0, and 1.1 will not include a monologue.

SIDE NOTE:
Just because future Alpha versions are listed in the note above as having or not having a Chad monologue does not mean that they are confirmed as having or not having a Chad monologue. They are listed as EXAMPLES, and are not hidden secrets.
